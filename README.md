# Estimation of Loss Given Default in Consumer Loan Portfolios Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the full implementation and documentation of my master's thesis titled **"Estimation of Loss Given Default in Consumer Loan Portfolios Using Machine Learning Algorithms"**.
The project was completed as part of the MSc in ECE Auth program.

## üìÑ Thesis Overview

The thesis focuses on the prediction of **Loss Given Default (LGD)** ‚Äî a critical metric in credit risk modeling ‚Äî by forecasting two key components:

- **Cure Rate**: The probability that a loan in default returns to performing status.
- **Recovery Rate**: The proportion of the loan recovered after default.

The methodology involves applying various machine learning algorithms to model and predict these rates, ultimately deriving LGD estimates.

## üß† Methodology

- Data preprocessing & feature selection
- Classification models for Cure Rate prediction
- Regression models for Recovery Rate prediction
- Grid search for hyperparameter optimization
- Performance evaluation using appropriate error and control metrics
- Feature importance analysis and interpretability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
